    content: `In today's competitive job market, creating a professional resume that stands out is more important than ever. With the rise of AI resume builders and ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems), job seekers need to adapt their resume strategy. This comprehensive guide will show you exactly how to build a professional resume with AI in 2025.

## Why AI Resume Builders Are Changing the Game

The traditional resume writing process can be time-consuming and frustrating. Many job seekers struggle with formatting, content optimization, and keyword placement. This is where AI resume builders come in to revolutionize the process.

AI-powered resume tools like AI Resume Forge, Rezi.ai, and Resume.io use advanced algorithms to analyze job descriptions, suggest relevant keywords, and optimize your content for ATS systems. Unlike manual resume writing, AI resume generators can process thousands of successful resume examples to provide data-driven recommendations.

Studies show that resumes created with AI assistance have a 40% higher chance of passing ATS screening compared to manually written resumes. The key advantage is that AI resume builders understand what hiring managers and automated systems are looking for.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Create Your AI Resume

Creating your professional resume with AI is simpler than you might think. Follow these steps to build a resume that gets results:

### Step 1: Choose the Right AI Resume Template

The foundation of a great resume starts with selecting an appropriate template. Modern AI resume builders offer ATS-friendly templates that are both visually appealing and machine-readable. When choosing your resume template, look for:

- Clean, professional layouts with clear section headers
- Appropriate white space for readability
- Standard fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman
- Single-column formats (dual-column resumes often confuse ATS systems)

Our AI Resume Forge platform offers multiple professionally designed resume templates optimized for 2025 job market standards. Each template is tested against major ATS systems to ensure maximum compatibility.

### Step 2: Add Your Personal Information Strategically

Your personal information section should include your full name, professional title, phone number, email address, and LinkedIn profile (if applicable). The AI resume builder will automatically format this information for optimal visibility.

Pro tip: Use a professional email address (preferably firstname.lastname@email.com) and ensure your LinkedIn profile is updated before including the link on your resume.

### Step 3: Let AI Suggest Optimized Content

This is where AI resume generators truly shine. Instead of spending hours crafting bullet points, AI can analyze your job title and experience level to suggest professional, achievement-focused content.

For example, if you input "Software Engineer" and "Developed applications," an AI resume builder might suggest: "Developed and maintained scalable web applications using React and Node.js, resulting in 40% improvement in page load times and enhanced user experience for 50,000+ monthly users."

The AI uses natural language processing to transform basic job duties into compelling, results-oriented accomplishments that hiring managers want to see.

### Step 4: Optimize for ATS and Keywords

One of the most critical aspects of modern resume writing is ATS optimization. Applicant Tracking Systems scan resumes for specific keywords and formatting before a human ever sees your application.

AI resume builders automatically incorporate relevant keywords from your industry, analyze job descriptions, and suggest modifications to improve your ATS score. This ensures your resume makes it past the initial screening and into the hands of hiring managers.

### Step 5: Review, Customize, and Download

After the AI generates your resume, take time to review and personalize the content. While AI provides excellent suggestions, adding your unique voice and specific achievements makes your resume stand out.

Once you're satisfied, download your resume as a PDF to preserve formatting. Our free AI resume builder allows instant PDF downloads without requiring signup or payment.

## Common Resume Mistakes to Avoid

Even with AI assistance, certain mistakes can derail your job search. Here are the most critical errors to avoid:

### Overusing Industry Buzzwords

While keywords are important for ATS, stuffing your resume with buzzwords like "synergy," "thought leader," or "go-getter" can make you sound generic. Focus on specific, quantifiable achievements instead.

### Using the Wrong File Format

Always submit resumes as PDF files unless specifically requested otherwise. Word documents can display differently on various devices, potentially ruining your carefully crafted formatting.

### Forgetting to Customize for Each Application

The biggest mistake job seekers make is sending the same resume to every employer. Use your AI resume builder to quickly customize your resume for each application by incorporating keywords from the specific job description.

### Neglecting Proper Section Organization

Standard resume sections should appear in this order: Contact Information, Professional Summary, Work Experience, Education, Skills, and optional sections like Certifications or Projects. AI resume templates follow this proven structure automatically.

## Optimize Your Resume for ATS Success

Understanding how Applicant Tracking Systems work is crucial for job search success. Here's what you need to know:

ATS software scans your resume for specific keywords, job titles, skills, and formatting. Resumes that don't meet certain criteria are automatically rejected, often before any human review.

To ensure ATS compatibility:

- Use standard section headings (avoid creative titles like "My Journey" instead of "Work Experience")
- Include both acronyms and full terms (e.g., "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)")
- List skills exactly as they appear in job descriptions
- Avoid graphics, tables, and complex formatting
- Use a reverse-chronological format for work experience

Our comprehensive ATS optimization guide provides detailed strategies for beating applicant tracking systems. AI resume builders handle most of these technical requirements automatically, giving you a significant advantage.

## Free AI Tools to Improve Your Resume

Beyond dedicated AI resume builders, several free tools can enhance your resume:

**AI Resume Forge** - Our platform offers completely free AI-powered resume creation with no signup required. Generate professional resumes in minutes with instant PDF downloads.

**ChatGPT** - Use ChatGPT to brainstorm achievement statements, rephrase bullet points, or generate cover letter content that complements your resume.

Combining these AI tools for job seekers creates a powerful toolkit for crafting compelling applications.

## Tailoring Your AI Resume for Different Industries

Different industries have unique resume expectations. Here's how to customize your AI-generated resume:

**Tech Industry**: Emphasize technical skills, programming languages, and quantifiable project outcomes. Include links to GitHub, portfolio, or live projects.

**Creative Fields**: Balance professional formatting with subtle creative elements. Include links to online portfolios showcasing your work.

**Finance/Banking**: Focus on quantifiable results, certifications (CFA, CPA), and demonstrate attention to detail through flawless formatting.

**Healthcare**: Highlight certifications, licenses, continuing education, and patient care achievements.

**Education**: Emphasize teaching philosophy, curriculum development, and student success metrics.

AI resume generators can adapt templates and content suggestions based on your target industry, ensuring your resume meets sector-specific expectations.

## The Future of AI Resume Building

As we move further into 2025, AI resume technology continues to evolve. Emerging trends include:

- Real-time job market analysis that suggests in-demand skills to add
- Video resume integration with AI-generated scripts

    content: `Landing your first job can feel like an impossible challenge when every position requires experience, but you can't get experience without a job. This classic catch-22 frustrates countless entry-level job seekers every year.

The good news? You absolutely can create a compelling, professional resume even without traditional work experience. This comprehensive guide shows you exactly how to write a resume with no experience that gets interviews in 2025.

## Understanding What "Experience" Really Means

First, let's reframe how you think about experience. Hiring managers aren't just looking for previous job titlesâ€”they're evaluating your skills, potential, and ability to contribute to their organization.

Experience comes in many forms beyond traditional employment:

- Academic projects and coursework
- Volunteer work and community service
- Internships and apprenticeships
- Freelance or gig work
- Student organizations and clubs
- Personal projects and hobbies
- Part-time or seasonal jobs

Each of these experiences has developed transferable skills that employers value. The key is presenting these experiences strategically on your entry-level resume.

## Best Resume Format for No Experience

When you lack extensive work history, format becomes crucial. The right resume structure can highlight your strengths while minimizing attention to limited experience.

### Recommended Format: Education-First Resume

For candidates with no work experience, placing your education section near the top (right after your contact information and summary) is strategic. This immediately shows hiring managers your qualifications and recent knowledge.

**Resume Structure for No Experience:**

1. Contact Information
2. Professional Summary or Objective
3. Education
4. Relevant Skills
5. Projects and Achievements
6. Volunteer Experience
7. Additional Sections (Certifications, Languages, etc.)

This format emphasizes what you bring to the table rather than what you lack. AI resume builders can automatically structure your resume this way when you indicate you're an entry-level candidate.

## Writing a Compelling Professional Summary

Your professional summary is prime real estate on your resumeâ€”typically the first content hiring managers read after your name. For candidates with no experience, this section is your chance to immediately communicate your value.

**Weak Example:**
"Recent graduate looking for an entry-level position to gain experience in marketing."

**Strong Example:**
"Recent Marketing graduate with honors specialization in Digital Marketing and Social Media Strategy. Managed social media campaigns for 3 nonprofit organizations, increasing engagement by an average of 45%. Proficient in Google Analytics, Facebook Ads Manager, and content creation tools. Eager to apply data-driven marketing strategies to drive growth for a dynamic organization."

Notice how the strong example focuses on specific skills, achievements, and value proposition rather than what you're seeking. Even without formal employment, you can craft a compelling narrative.

## Leveraging Your Education Section

For recent graduates and students, your education section is powerful. Maximize its impact by including more than just your degree and school name.

**What to Include in Your Education Section:**

- Degree type and major (include minor if relevant)
- University or college name and location
- Graduation date (or expected graduation date)
- GPA (if 3.5 or higher)
- Relevant coursework that aligns with target jobs
- Academic honors and awards (Dean's List, scholarships, etc.)
- Thesis or capstone project titles
- Study abroad experiences

**Example:**

**Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**
University of California, Berkeley | Graduated May 2025 | GPA: 3.8/4.0

*Relevant Coursework:* Data Structures & Algorithms, Machine Learning, Web Development, Database Systems, Software Engineering

*Honors:* Dean's List (6 semesters), CS Department Outstanding Achievement Award

*Senior Project:* Developed machine learning model to predict student performance with 87% accuracy using Python and TensorFlow

This detailed education section demonstrates substantial knowledge and achievement even without work experience.

## Transforming Projects into Experience

Academic projects, personal initiatives, and volunteer work are legitimate experience. The secret is describing them using the same professional language you'd use for paid employment.

### Academic Projects as Experience

Every course project you completed developed real skills. Present them professionally:

**Software Development Project**
*Team Lead | CS 160 Software Engineering Course | Jan 2025 - May 2025*

- Led team of 4 students in developing e-commerce web application using React and Node.js
- Implemented user authentication, product catalog, and payment processing features
- Conducted code reviews and managed project timeline using Agile methodology
- Delivered fully functional application on schedule, receiving grade of A+

Notice the action verbs (Led, Implemented, Conducted, Delivered) and specific details. This reads like professional experience because it *is* professional experience.

### Personal Projects Show Initiative

Personal projects demonstrate passion, self-motivation, and practical skillsâ€”qualities employers highly value.

**Personal Finance Tracking App**
*Creator & Developer | March 2025 - Present*

- Designed and developed mobile app to track expenses and visualize spending patterns
- Utilized React Native for cross-platform compatibility and Firebase for backend
- Implemented data visualization using Chart.js to present financial insights
- Published app on GitHub with comprehensive documentation

Hiring managers love seeing candidates who build things in their spare time. It shows genuine interest beyond just getting a paycheck.

## Highlighting Transferable Skills

Transferable skills are abilities that apply across different jobs and industries. Even without work experience, you've developed numerous transferable skills through education and life experiences.

**Key Transferable Skills to Highlight:**

**Communication Skills:**
- Presentation experience from class projects
- Written communication from essays and reports
- Collaboration from group projects
- Active listening from customer service volunteering

**Problem-Solving Skills:**
- Analytical thinking from coursework
- Creative solutions from project challenges
- Critical thinking from research papers
- Troubleshooting from technical projects

**Technical Skills:**
- Software proficiency (Microsoft Office, Adobe Suite, etc.)
- Programming languages
- Data analysis tools
- Social media platforms
- Industry-specific software

**Organizational Skills:**
- Time management from balancing coursework
- Project planning from group assignments
- Multitasking from extracurricular involvement
- Attention to detail from academic work

Create a dedicated Skills section that lists both hard skills (technical abilities) and soft skills (interpersonal qualities). Use our free resume templates to organize these effectively.

## Volunteer Experience and Extracurricular Activities

Volunteer work and extracurricular involvement demonstrate character, commitment, and skill development. These experiences absolutely belong on your resume.

**How to Present Volunteer Experience:**

**Social Media Coordinator (Volunteer)**
*Local Animal Shelter | June 2024 - Present*

- Manage Instagram and Facebook accounts with combined following of 5,000+
- Create engaging content that increased adoption inquiries by 60%
- Coordinate with volunteers to photograph adoptable animals
- Respond to online inquiries and provide information to potential adopters

This example shows real responsibility and measurable resultsâ€”exactly what hiring managers want to see.

**Extracurricular Leadership:**

**Vice President**
*University Marketing Association | Sept 2024 - May 2025*

- Coordinated monthly workshops featuring industry professionals
- Managed organization budget of $3,000 and event planning for 50+ members
- Collaborated with executive board to increase membership by 40%
- Organized annual career fair connecting students with 25 marketing firms

Leadership roles in student organizations develop management, organizational, and interpersonal skills directly applicable to professional environments.

## Using AI to Enhance Your First Resume

AI resume builders are particularly valuable for entry-level candidates because they suggest professional language and help articulate experiences you might undersell.

When using an AI resume builder for your first resume:

1. Input all your experiences (academic, volunteer, projects, etc.)
2. Let AI suggest professional descriptions and action verbs
3. Review AI-generated bullet points for accuracy and personalization
4. Ensure the AI optimizes your resume for ATS systems
5. Download your professional resume as a PDF

Many entry-level job seekers don't realize how valuable their experiences are. AI tools help you recognize and articulate your worth effectively.

## Tailoring Your Resume for Specific Jobs

Generic resumes don't workâ€”especially when you have no experience. Customizing your resume for each application is essential.

**How to Tailor Your Entry-Level Resume:**

1. Read the job description carefully and identify key requirements
2. Highlight experiences that demonstrate those specific skills
3. Incorporate exact keywords from the job posting
4. Reorder your skills section to prioritize the most relevant abilities
5. Adjust your professional summary to align with the role

For example, if applying to a data analyst position that emphasizes Excel and SQL skills, ensure those skills are prominently featured even if you only used them in coursework.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid on Your First Resume

Entry-level candidates often make these critical mistakes:

### Mistake 1: Using an Objective Instead of a Summary

Outdated resume objectives that state what you want (rather than what you offer) waste valuable space. Focus on your value proposition instead.

### Mistake 2: Listing Job Duties Without Achievements

Even in part-time or volunteer roles, focus on what you accomplished, not just what you were supposed to do.

**Weak:** "Responsible for customer service at retail store"
**Strong:** "Provided exceptional customer service, maintaining 95% customer satisfaction rating and contributing to 20% increase in repeat customers"

### Mistake 3: Including Irrelevant Information

High school achievements, hobbies unrelated to the job, and personal information (age, marital status, photo) don't belong on professional resumes.

### Mistake 4: Poor Formatting and Typos

Nothing says "inexperienced" like formatting errors and typos. Use professional resume templates and proofread carefullyâ€”or better yet, use an AI resume checker to catch mistakes.

### Mistake 5: Making Your Resume Too Long

Entry-level resumes should be one page. Be concise and selective about what you include.

## Alternative Sections to Strengthen Your Resume

When you lack work experience, these optional sections can add substance:

**Certifications and Licenses:**
List any relevant certifications (Google Analytics Certified, Adobe Certified Associate, CPR Certified, etc.)

**Languages:**
Bilingual or multilingual abilities are valuable assets in many industries.

**Technical Skills:**
Programming languages, software proficiency, and technical tools deserve their own section in tech fields.

**Publications and Presentations:**
Any published writing or conference presentations demonstrate expertise.

**Awards and Honors:**
Academic and community recognition shows excellence.

## Cover Letter Strategies for No Experience

While this guide focuses on resumes, your cover letter is equally important when you lack experience. Use your cover letter to:

- Explain your genuine interest in the company and role
- Tell the story behind your career choice
- Highlight specific skills that match the job requirements
- Express enthusiasm and willingness to learn
- Demonstrate research about the company

Check out our cover letter examples guide for templates and strategies.

## Taking Action: Build Your First Resume Today

Creating your first resume might feel daunting, but with the right approach and tools, you can develop a professional document that opens doors.

**Your Next Steps:**

1. Inventory all your experiences (academic, volunteer, projects, etc.)
2. Identify transferable skills you've developed
3. Choose an ATS-friendly resume template
4. Write strong bullet points focused on achievements
5. Customize your resume for each application
6. Proofread carefully or use AI tools to catch errors
7. Save as PDF and start applying

Don't let lack of traditional work experience hold you back. Thousands of entry-level candidates land great jobs every day by effectively showcasing their potential.

## Conclusion

You don't need years of work experience to create a compelling resume. By strategically highlighting your education, projects, volunteer work, and transferable skills, you can demonstrate significant value to employers.

The key is presenting these experiences professionally, using action-oriented language, and customizing your approach for each opportunity.

    content: `Choosing the right resume format can make or break your job search success. With ATS systems becoming more sophisticated and hiring managers spending only 6-7 seconds on initial resume reviews, your format choice matters more than ever in 2025.

This comprehensive guide breaks down the three main resume formats, explains when to use each one, and provides expert recommendations for maximizing your interview callbacks.

## The Three Main Resume Formats

There are three standard resume formats used in 2025, each serving different purposes and career situations.

### 1. Reverse-Chronological Resume Format (Most Common)

The reverse-chronological format lists your work experience starting with your most recent position and working backward. This is the most traditional and widely accepted resume format.

**Structure:**
- Contact Information
- Professional Summary
- Work Experience (most recent first)
- Education
- Skills
- Additional Sections

**Best For:**
- Professionals with consistent work history
- Career advancement within the same field
- Candidates with impressive recent experience
- Traditional industries (finance, law, healthcare)

**Advantages:**
- Most familiar to hiring managers and recruiters
- Easily scanned by ATS systems
- Clearly shows career progression
- Highlights recent, relevant experience

**Disadvantages:**
- Exposes employment gaps
- May highlight job-hopping
- Not ideal for career changers
- Can emphasize lack of experience for entry-level candidates

The reverse-chronological format remains the gold standard for most job applications in 2025. If you have a solid work history in your field, this is your best choice.

### 2. Functional (Skills-Based) Resume Format

The functional resume format emphasizes skills and abilities over chronological work history. Instead of listing jobs with descriptions, you organize content by skill categories.

**Structure:**
- Contact Information
- Professional Summary
- Skills and Accomplishments (organized by category)
- Brief Work History (company names, titles, dates only)
- Education

**Best For:**
- Career changers pivoting to new industries
- Candidates with significant employment gaps
- Entry-level candidates with limited experience
- Freelancers or consultants with varied project work

**Advantages:**
- Highlights transferable skills
- Minimizes employment gaps
- Emphasizes abilities over timeline
- Good for diverse project-based experience

**Disadvantages:**
- Many hiring managers view it skeptically
- Can raise red flags about hiding something
- Less ATS-friendly than chronological format
- Doesn't show career progression

**Warning:** While functional resumes can be useful in specific situations, many recruiters dislike this format because it obscures work history. Use cautiously and only when absolutely necessary.

### 3. Combination (Hybrid) Resume Format

The combination format merges elements of both chronological and functional resumes. It leads with a skills section but also includes detailed reverse-chronological work history.

**Structure:**
- Contact Information
- Professional Summary
- Skills Summary (top 8-10 core competencies)
- Work Experience (reverse-chronological with detailed bullets)
- Education
- Additional Sections

**Best For:**
- Mid-to-senior level professionals
- Career changers with some relevant experience
- Candidates with diverse skill sets
- Technical professionals (IT, engineering)

**Advantages:**
- Highlights both skills and experience
- More flexible than pure chronological
- Works well for ATS systems
- Shows comprehensive qualifications

**Disadvantages:**
- Can be longer than one page
- Requires more space
- May seem repetitive if not crafted carefully
- Complex to design effectively

The combination format has grown in popularity and is considered best practice for many professionals in 2025, especially those with 5+ years of experience.

## Which Resume Format Should You Choose?

Your ideal resume format depends on your specific situation, industry, and career goals.

### Choose Reverse-Chronological If You:

- Have consistent work history in your field
- Are applying to traditional industries
- Have impressive recent job titles or employers
- Want to show clear career progression
- Are staying in the same industry

### Choose Functional Format If You:

- Are changing careers completely
- Have significant gaps in employment
- Are entering the workforce for the first time
- Have limited relevant work experience
- Are a freelancer with project-based work

### Choose Combination Format If You:

- Have 5+ years of diverse experience
- Possess strong technical or specialized skills
- Are moving into leadership roles
- Work in competitive industries
- Want to highlight both skills and experience

Most professionals will find the reverse-chronological or combination format most effective for their 2025 job search.

## Resume Format Trends for 2025

Resume design and formatting expectations continue evolving. Here are the key trends shaping resume formats in 2025:

### Minimalist Design Dominates

Clean, simple layouts with plenty of white space have replaced busy, overly designed resumes. Minimalist formats improve readability for both humans and ATS systems.

**Key elements:**
- Single-column layouts (avoid two-column formats that confuse ATS)
- Standard fonts: Arial, Calibri, Garamond, or Helvetica
- Font size: 10-12pt for body text, 14-16pt for your name
- Consistent formatting throughout
- Strategic use of bold and italics for emphasis

### ATS Optimization Is Non-Negotiable

With 98% of Fortune 500 companies using ATS systems, your resume format must be machine-readable. ATS-friendly resume templates avoid:

- Tables and text boxes
- Headers and footers
- Graphics and images
- Unusual fonts or characters
- Complex formatting

Our comprehensive ATS optimization guide provides detailed strategies for ensuring your resume passes automated screening.

### Mobile-Friendly Formatting Matters

Many recruiters now review resumes on mobile devices. Your resume format should look professional on phones and tablets, not just desktop computers.

**Mobile-friendly practices:**
- Single-column layout
- Clear section headers
- Adequate spacing between sections
- Standard page margins (0.5" to 1")
- PDF format to preserve formatting

### Data-Driven Results Take Center Stage

Modern resume formats emphasize quantifiable achievements over job duties. Structure your experience bullets to highlight measurable impact.

**Format for achievement bullets:**
[Action Verb] + [Task] + [Result/Metric]

**Example:**
"Increased customer retention by 35% by implementing automated email campaign, resulting in $2.4M additional annual revenue"

### One Page Still Preferred (With Exceptions)

For most professionals with less than 10 years of experience, one-page resumes remain ideal. However, exceptions exist:

**Two-page resumes are acceptable for:**
- Senior executives (Director level and above)
- Academic/research positions requiring publication lists
- Federal government applications
- Professionals with 10+ years of highly relevant experience
- Technical roles requiring extensive skills/certifications

Never exceed two pages. If you can't fit your experience in two pages, you're including too much detail.

## Industry-Specific Resume Format Recommendations

## Common Resume Format Mistakes to Avoid

Even small formatting errors can cost you interview opportunities. Avoid these critical mistakes:

### Mistake 1: Using Tables for Layout

While tables might look organized to you, ATS systems often can't read content in tables correctly. Stick to simple text formatting.

### Mistake 2: Inconsistent Formatting

Changing font sizes, bullet styles, or spacing throughout your resume looks unprofessional. Maintain consistency in:
- Bullet point style
- Date formatting
- Company name formatting
- Section header styling

### Mistake 3: Too Much Text Density

Massive blocks of text overwhelm readers. Use:
- 3-5 bullet points per position (not 8-10)
- White space between sections
- Clear section breaks
- Concise language

### Mistake 4: Unconventional Section Names

Creative section titles confuse ATS systems and hiring managers. Use standard headers:
- Work Experience (not "My Professional Journey")
- Education (not "Academic Background")
- Skills (not "Core Competencies")

### Mistake 5: Including Unnecessary Information

Modern resume formats exclude:
- Objective statements (use professional summary instead)
- "References available upon request"
- Full mailing address (city and state suffice)
- Photos (unless required in your country)
- Age, marital status, or personal information

### Mistake 6: Using Graphics and Icons

While infographic resumes might look appealing, they typically fail ATS screening. Save creative designs for portfolios, not job applications.

## How to Format Different Resume Sections

Proper formatting of individual resume sections enhances overall impact.

### Contact Information Format

**Include:**
- Full name (larger font size)
- Phone number
- Professional email address
- City, State (full address unnecessary)
- LinkedIn profile URL
- Portfolio or personal website (if relevant)

**Format:**
Center aligned or left aligned at the top of the page. Use slightly larger font size for your name to make it stand out.

### Professional Summary Format

3-4 lines of text summarizing your experience, skills, and value proposition. Use this space to include high-value keywords.

**Format:**
Left aligned, 3-5 sentences or bullet points, placed immediately after contact information.

### Work Experience Format

**Each position should include:**
Company Name | City, State
Job Title | Start Date - End Date
- Bullet point achievements
- Bullet point achievements
- Bullet point achievements

**Formatting tips:**
- Bold company names or job titles (choose one, be consistent)
- Right-align dates or left-align with vertical bar separator
- Use 3-5 bullet points per position
- Lead each bullet with strong action verb

### Education Format

**Include:**
Degree Type, Major
University Name | City, State | Graduation Year

**Optional additions:**
- GPA (if 3.5+)
- Relevant coursework
- Academic honors
- Study abroad

**Formatting tips:**
- Reverse chronological order (most recent degree first)
- Omit high school if you have a college degree
- Include graduation date unless you graduated more than 15 years ago

### Skills Format

**Options:**
1. Simple list with commas: "Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, SQL, Git"
2. Categorized sections: "Programming Languages: Python, Java, C++"
3. Proficiency levels: "Advanced: Python, SQL | Intermediate: JavaScript, React"

**Formatting tip:**
Use the format that makes your most relevant skills easy to scan. Include keywords from job descriptions.

**Plain text tips:**

- Use dashes or asterisks for bullet points
- Keep line length to 65 characters
- Paste into application instead of uploading
